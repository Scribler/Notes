DATABASES

RESEARCH TOPICS
  - Pallelizable (Parallell databases.)
  - testing database
  - 'history' - most databases DON'T remember old data after change
  - localization (so that your website will work with different languages > will substitue words for users language)
  - Big Data

security
  - sql injection
  - cross site scripting

SQL databases (relational)
- can make RULES
  - rules stop you from putting invalid information into a section.
  - has more security issues.
  - transactions (secure changes?)
  - relational queries

NOSQL databases
- 

GraphQL (query language - not a database)
  - good for people who don't want to learn a lot about databases.


1) open source VS closed sourced
2) Oracle > Biggest




SQLight > doesn't fallow all the standards
  - tiny
  - easy to learn
  - can embed in your app (You don't need a server running somewhere else)
  - If you don't know what you need (USE THIS)
  - If you need more (PostgresQL is great)





REDIS (for making things fast)
  - #1 > for 'key value lookups' EXTREMELY fast.
  - doesn't write to disk (for caching localy)
ACID (for SQL)
- Atomicity
- Consistancy
- Isolation
- Durability.

When using CAP theorem (really big stuff)
BASE (for no SQL)
- Basically Available
- Soft state
- Eventually Consistant

Postgres vs MySQL

Postgres
  - relational
  - richer environment
  - store map data, json, xml, tables, etc. and retern in any of the other data styles.
  - 
    

MySQL
  - bought by oracle
  - maria(opensource version)

MongoDB
  -
