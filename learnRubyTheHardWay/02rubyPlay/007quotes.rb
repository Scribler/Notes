# Here's some new strange stuff, remember type it exactly.

# assign the days to a string
days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"
# assign the months to a string with each month starting on a new line.
months = "\nJan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"


# print each day on a new line
puts "Here are the days: #{days}"

# print the days as a string
puts "Here are the months: #{months}"

# print a quote with the formatting kept. New lines will start on new lines.
puts %q{
There's something going on here.
With this weird quote
We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
}
